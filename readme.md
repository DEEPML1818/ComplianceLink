## Introduction

The Decentralized Compliance Engine (DCE) is designed to address regulatory and compliance needs within DeFi. It provides a fully decentralized, cross-chain KYC/AML compliance framework that is secure, efficient, and scalable. By integrating with the Circle Compliance API, Wormhole protocol, and deploying smart contracts on multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, and Sui), DCE ensures cross-border regulatory compliance, enabling DeFi applications to meet global standards while remaining decentralized.

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Compliance**: Enforces KYC/AML compliance across multiple blockchains using Wormhole.
- **Automated KYC/AML Checks**: Integrates Circle's Compliance API for seamless onboarding and compliance updates.
- **Decentralized Enforcement**: Smart contracts enforce compliance statuses, preventing non-compliant users from initiating transactions.
- **Real-Time Compliance Status**: Periodic checks and real-time updates ensure users stay compliant.
- **Scalability**: Built to handle high transaction volumes using Redis for task management and IPFS for decentralized data storage.

## Architecture

### Overview
DCE operates on a modular architecture comprising the following main components:
1. **API Layer** - Handles calls to Circle Compliance API and Wormhole SDK.
2. **Middleware** - Processes compliance responses and executes smart contract actions.
3. **Smart Contracts** - Enforce compliance on-chain and lock/unlock funds based on compliance status.
4. **Database** - Off-chain storage for user metadata, transaction logs, and audit trails.
5. **Blockchain Interactions** - Cross-chain transactions are facilitated using Wormhole protocol.

### Workflow
1. **User Onboarding** - Users submit KYC details, which are verified through Circle’s API.
2. **Compliance Check** - Circle's API response is processed, and user status is recorded on-chain.
3. **Cross-Chain Enforcement** - Compliance statuses are propagated across chains using Wormhole, maintaining user eligibility.
4. **Real-Time Updates** - Continuous compliance monitoring via Circle’s API ensures compliance status remains current.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Blockchain Interactions**:
  - **Ethereum**: Solidity for smart contracts
  - **Solana/Sui**: Rust for smart contracts
  - **Wormhole SDK** for cross-chain interactions
- **Database**: MongoDB/PostgreSQL for off-chain storage, Redis for message queuing
- **Storage**: IPFS for decentralized KYC document storage
- **Frontend**: Web3.js/Ethers.js for wallet integration (future)
